# This is a simple example of integrating Sulley for packet mutation with
# KillerBee as the delivery mechanism.  Sulley is a lot more sophisticated and
# can do a lot more interesting mutation than this simple example, but it
# should be enough to get you going.  I'm still working on a reliable "ping"
# function to measure the availability of the target.  -Josh
